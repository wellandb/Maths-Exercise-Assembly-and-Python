Part 1

Q1) After obeying the "LDR R0" instruction, the value of PC is 4 and of R0
is 0

Q2) After obeying the "LDR R1" instruction, the value of PC is 8 and of R1
is 4

Q3) After obeying the "LDR R2" instruction, the value of PC is C and of R2
is 3


(For Q4 and Q5, I am asking about the registers involved in the arithmetic,
not PC/R15)

Q4) The first time the "ADD" instruction is obeyed, the value of register R0
changes from 0 to 4

Q5) The first time the "SUB" instruction is obeyed, the value of register R2
changes from 3 to 2


(For Q6, Q7, and Q8, I am asking about the effect of running the program
from the beginning until it stops at the SWI instruction, not about the
effect of just one instruction)

Q6) the "BNE" instruction is obeyed 3 times but only performs the branch 2
times

Only 2 registers (other than the PC register) change value: R0 & R2

Q7) register R2 counts down from 3 to 0

Q8) the final value of register R0 is the sum (hint: arithmetic operation) of memory locations R1 and R2


Part 2

Q9) The memory location for "tom" is R0 because it was saved that way.

Q10) If you reset and run the program again without reloading it then what
happens to the value of "tom" and why: it will increase because the previous value has been stored and saved, each time you are adding on 12 (decimal) to the previous value.
